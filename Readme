Dummy Device Driver

This is a simple Linux kernel module that creates a character device driver called "dummy". The driver allows you to write and read data to and from the device, simulating a real device.


Installation


Before installing the driver, make sure that you have the necessary build tools and kernel headers installed on your system. You can install them with the following command:

command 1 : sudo apt-get update
command 2 : sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

To build and install the driver, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code:
git clone https://github.com/prashant8369/dummy-device-driver.git

command 3: mkdir -/dummy-driver
command 4 : cd /home/prashant/dummy-driver

command 5 : nano dummy.c
command 6 : nano Makefile

Build the driver using :
command 7 : make 
 

Load the driver into the kernel:
command 8 : sudo insmod dummy.ko

Check if the driver was loaded successfully:
 command 9 : sudo dmesg | tail
You should see a message that says "Dummy driver: Registered successfully with major number 238".


Create a device file for the driver:

command 10 :sudo mknod /dev/dummy c 238 0
command 11 :sudo chmod 666 /dev/dummy

Verify that the device file was created successfully:
command 12:ls -l /dev/dummy

You should see a line that says something like this:
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 238, 0 Apr 23 12:47 /dev/dummy

Usage

To use the dummy driver, you can write and read data to and from the device file (/dev/dummy). Here's an example program (test.c) that writes a message to the driver and then reads it back:

command 13 : nano test.c
command 14 : gcc -o test test.c
command 15 : sudo ./test

Uninstallation

Remove the device file:

command 16 :sudo rm /dev/dummy

Unload the driver from the kernel:

command 17 : sudo rmmod dummy
